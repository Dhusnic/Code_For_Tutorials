# Machine Learning

Machine Learning can be broadly classified into the following types:

1. Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data.
2. Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled training data. The goal is to discover hidden patterns in data.
3. Semi-Supervised Learning: The model learns from a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. This method can provide a significant improvement in learning accuracy.
4. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns to perform an action from experience. It is trained to make specific decisions by maximizing the reward in a particular situation.
5. Self-Learning: This is a subset of supervised learning where the machine teaches itself.
6. Feature Learning: The machine learns to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data.
7. Sparse Dictionary Learning: The machine learns to represent a given signal using very few atoms.
8. Anomaly Detection: The machine identifies unusual data points in a dataset.
9. Association Rules: The machine extracts interesting correlations, frequent patterns, associations or casual structures among sets of items in the transactional or relational datasets.
10. Regression: The machine predicts the continuous outputs.
11. Classification: The machine predicts the categorical outputs.

|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Input Data**         | Labeled data                                       | Unlabeled data                                      | State and reward signals                            |
| **Goal**               | To learn a mapping from input to output labels      | Discover underlying structure or patterns          | Learn a policy to maximize cumulative reward        |
| **Feedback**           | Feedback provided (correct answers) for training   | No feedback, algorithm finds patterns independently| Feedback based on rewards and penalties             |

| **Performance**        | Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, MSE         | Evaluated based on clustering quality, coherence   | Evaluated based on cumulative reward over time      |
| **Examples of Algorithms** | Linear regression, SVM, neural networks          | K-means, PCA, hierarchical clustering              | Q-learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN)                   |
