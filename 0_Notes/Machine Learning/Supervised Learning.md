# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning can be broadly classified into two types:

1. **Regression**: This type of supervised learning deals with continuous or real-valued outputs. Examples include predicting house prices or stock prices.
2. **Classification**: This type deals with discrete or categorical outputs. Examples include identifying whether an email is spam or not (binary classification), or recognizing handwritten digits (multiclass classification).

Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Here are some common types of regression, along with their steps, examples, and formulas:

### 1. **Linear Regression**

**Description**: Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation.

**Steps**:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather data for the dependent variable (Y) and independent variable(s) (X).
2. **Visualize Data**: Plot the data to check for a linear relationship.
3. **Fit the Model**: Use the least squares method to fit a line through the data points.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Check the goodness-of-fit using R-squared and residual analysis.
5. **Make Predictions**: Use the fitted model to make predictions.

**Example**: Predicting house prices based on square footage.

**Formula**:
Y=β0+β1X+ϵ
where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, β0 is the intercept, β1 is the slope, and ϵ is the error term.

### 2. **Multiple Linear Regression**

**Description**: An extension of linear regression that uses multiple independent variables to predict a single dependent variable.

**Steps**:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather data for the dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
2. **Visualize Data**: Check for relationships between the dependent variable and each independent variable.
3. **Fit the Model**: Use the least squares method to fit a linear equation.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess R-squared, adjust R-squared, and conduct residual analysis.
5. **Make Predictions**: Use the model to predict the dependent variable.

**Example**: Predicting house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.

**Formula**:
Y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+⋯+βpXp+ϵ
where YY is the dependent variable, X1,X2,…,Xp are independent variables, β0 is the intercept, β1,β2,…,βp are the coefficients, and ϵ is the error term.

### 3. **Polynomial Regression**

**Description**: A form of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.

**Steps**:

1. **Collect Data**: Gather data for the dependent variable and independent variable.
2. **Visualize Data**: Plot the data and check for a non-linear relationship.

**Example**: Predicting whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on study hours.

**Formula**:
log⁡(P(Y=1)/1−P(Y=1))=β0+β1X1+β2X2+⋯+βpXp
where P(Y=1) is the probability of the dependent variable being 1, and X1,X2,…,Xp are independent variables.

where λλ is the regularization parameter.

### 6. **Lasso Regression**

where λλ is the regularization parameter.

### 7. **Elastic Net Regression**

1. **Collect Data**: Gather data for the dependent and independent variables.
2. **Standardize Data**: Normalize the data.
3. **Fit the Model**: Use a mix of L1 and L2 penalties.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Use cross-validation to find the best mix of penalties.
5. **Make Predictions**: Use the elastic net model to make predictions.

**Example**: Predicting health outcomes with many predictors, balancing between lasso's feature selection and ridge's coefficient shrinkage.

**Formula**:
Minimize(∑i=1n(Yi−β0−∑j=1pβjXij)2+λ1∑j=1p∣βj∣+λ2∑j=1pβj2)Minimize(∑i=1n(Yi−β0−∑j=1pβjXij)2+λ1∑j=1p∣βj∣+λ2∑j=1pβj2)
where λ1λ1 and λ2λ2 are the regularization parameters.

These types of regression analysis help in understanding the relationship between variables and making informed predictions based on data.
