# HTML Tag Types

## Basic Tags

- `<html>`: This is the root element of an HTML page.
- `<head>`: This contains meta-information about the HTML document.
- `<title>`: This specifies a title for the HTML document.
- `<body>`: This contains the visible page content.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: These define HTML headings, with `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.
- `<p>`: This defines a paragraph.
- ``: This inserts a single line break.
- `<hr>`: This produces a horizontal line.

## HTML5 Tags

HTML5 introduced several new elements to better structure HTML documents:

- `<header>`: This represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. It can contain some heading elements and a logo.
- `<nav>`: This is intended for major block of navigation links.
- `<section>`: This represents a standalone section of functionality contained within an HTML document, such as an article, a blog entry, or any other piece of content that could stand alone.
- `<article>`: This specifies independent, self-contained content.
- `<aside>`: This is used for content that is aside from the content it is placed in.
- `<footer>`: This represents a container for the section's footer, and can contain information about the author, copyright information, etc.
- `<details>`: This tag is used as a disclosure widget from which the user can retrieve additional information.
- `<summary>`: This tag is used as a heading for the `<details>` element. The heading can be clicked to view/hide the details.

## `<div>` vs `<span>`

The `<div>` and `<span>` tags are both used to group other elements, but they have different functions within an HTML document.

- `<div>`: This is a block-level element. It creates a large box that other block-level elements and inline elements can be contained within. The `<div>` tag is often used for layout purposes, to group other elements together to apply styles to them, or to take advantage of more complex or specific CSS selectors.
- `<span>`: This is an inline element. It creates a small box that only contains a single line of text, or other inline elements. The `<span>` tag is often used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line of text, that might need to be formatted in a different way to the rest of the text.

## List

- `<ul>`: Unordered list. It is used to group a set of related items in no particular order.
- `<ol>`: Ordered list. It is used to group a set of related items in a specific order.
- `<li>`: List item. It is used to represent an item in a list.
- `<dl>`: Description list. It is used to display name-value groups.
- `<dt>`: Description term. It is used to specify a term in a description list.
- `<dd>`: Description detail. It is used to describe a term in a description list.

## Table

- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<tr>`: Defines a row in a table.
- `<th>`: Defines a header cell in a table.
- `<td>`: Defines a cell in a table.
- `<caption>`: Defines a table caption.
- `<colgroup>`: Specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting.
- `<col>`: Specifies column properties for each column within a `<colgroup>` element.
- `<thead>`: Groups the header content in a table.
- `<tbody>`: Groups the body content in a table.
- `<tfoot>`: Groups the footer content in a table.

## Form

- `<form>`: Represents a document section that contains interactive controls for submitting information to a web server.

In HTML5, the `<form>` element can contain several other elements to enhance its functionality. Here are some of them:

- `<input>`: The input element is used to create interactive controls for form-based applications on web pages.
- `<textarea>`: The textarea element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control for the element's raw value.
- `<button>`: The button element represents a clickable button.
- `<select>`: The select element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
- `<option>`: The option element is used to define an item within a select, an optgroup, or a datalist HTML5 element.
- `<fieldset>`: The fieldset element is used to group several controls as well as labels within a web form.
- `<label>`: The label element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
- `<legend>`: The legend element represents a caption for the content of its parent fieldset.

## Graphical Tags in HTML5

- `<img>`: The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The image source file is defined in the `src` attribute.
- `<canvas>`: The canvas tag is used to draw graphics on a web page. It is only a container for graphics, and you must use JavaScript to render the graphics.
- `<svg>`: The svg tag is used to define Scalable Vector Graphics in HTML. It can be used to draw advanced shapes combined from lines, curves, and simple shapes.
- `<figure>`: The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
- `<figcaption>`: The figcaption tag is used to provide a caption for a `<figure>` element. It can be placed as the first or last child of a `<figure>` block.
- `<video>`: The video tag is used to embed video content in a document. It can contain one or more video sources.
- `<audio>`: The audio tag is used to embed sound content in a document. It can contain one or more audio sources.

# Selectors

## Selectors in HTML5

Selectors are used to select and manipulate HTML elements. Here are some types of selectors in HTML5:

- **Element Selector**: This selector selects elements based on the element name. For example, `p {color: red;}` will apply the style to all `<p>` elements.
- **Id Selector**: This selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element. For example, `#myId {color: blue;}` will apply the style to the element with id="myId".
- **Class Selector**: This selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. It is used with a period character followed by the name of the class. For example, `.myClass {background-color: yellow;}` will apply the style to all elements with class="myClass".
- **Universal Selector**: This selector matches any element type. It is denoted by an asterisk (*). For example, `{margin: 0; padding: 0;}` will apply the style to all elements on the page.
- **Grouping Selector**: This selector is used to select and style multiple elements at once. It groups selectors by separating each selector with a comma. For example, `h1, h2, p {text-align: center;}` will center align the text of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` elements.
- **Attribute Selector**: This selector is used to select elements based on an attribute or attribute value. For example, `a[target="_blank"] {background-color: red;}` will apply a background color to all `<a>` elements with a target attribute value of "_blank".
- **Pseudo-class Selector**: This selector is used to style an element when it gets into a certain state. For example, `a:hover {color: red;}` will apply the style when the mouse hovers over the `<a>` elements.

## Priority in HTML5 Selectors

The order of priority or specificity in HTML5 selectors from highest to lowest is as follows:

1. **Inline styles**: An inline style is attached directly to the HTML element. It has the highest priority. If an inline style is defined, it will override any styles declared in external CSS files and/or CSS embedded in the head section.
Example:
    
    ```html
    <p style="color: blue;">This is an example of an inline style.</p>
    
    ```
    
2. **Id Selector**: This selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. The id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element.
Example:
    
    ```css
    #myId {color: blue;}
    
    ```
    
    ```html
    <p id="myId">This is an example of an id selector.</p>
    
    ```
    
3. **Class Selector**: This selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. It is used with a period character followed by the name of the class.
Example:
    
    ```css
    .myClass {color: red;}
    
    ```
    
    ```html
    <p class="myClass">This is an example of a class selector.</p>
    
    ```
    
4. **Element Selector**: This selector selects elements based on the element name.
Example:
    
    ```css
    p {color: green;}
    
    ```
    
    ```html
    <p>This is an example of an element selector.</p>
    
    ```
    
5. **Universal Selector**: This selector matches any element type. It is denoted by an asterisk (*). For example, `{color: yellow;}` will apply the style to all elements on the page.
Example:
    
    ```css
    * {color: yellow;}
    
    ```
    
6. **Grouping Selector**: This selector is used to select and style multiple elements at once. It groups selectors by separating each selector with a comma.
Example:
    
    ```css
    h1, h2, p {text-align: center;}
    
    ```
    
    ```html
    <h1>A heading</h1>
    <h2>Another heading</h2>
    <p>A paragraph.</p>
    
    ```
    
7. **Attribute Selector**: This selector is used to select elements based on an attribute or attribute value.
Example:
    
    ```css
    a[target="_blank"] {background-color: red;}
    
    ```
    
    ```html
    <a href="<http://example.com>" target="_blank">Link</a>
    
    ```
    
8. **Pseudo-class Selector**: This selector is used to style an element when it gets into a certain state.
Example:
    
    ```css
    a:hover {color: red;}
    
    ```
    
    ```html
    <a href="<http://example.com>">Hover over me</a>
    
    ```
