## **1. MAC Address (Media Access Control Address)**

### **Bit-wise Structure**
- **Length**: 48 bits (6 bytes).
- **Representation**: Typically displayed in hexadecimal format (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`).
  - **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)**: The first 24 bits (3 bytes) represent the manufacturer of the network interface card (NIC).
  - **NIC Specific Identifier**: The last 24 bits (3 bytes) are unique to each NIC produced by the manufacturer.

### **Purpose**
- **Uniqueness**: Ensures that each network interface card (NIC) has a unique identifier on the network.
- **Local Communication**: Used for communication within the same local network segment or broadcast domain (e.g., Ethernet LAN).
- **Hardware Address**: Operates at the hardware level, facilitating low-level network access and communication.

### **OSI Layer**
- **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: Handles frame creation, error detection, and MAC address handling.

## **2. IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**

### **Bit-wise Structure**
- **IPv4**:
  - **Length**: 32 bits (4 bytes).
  - **Representation**: Divided into four octets, each represented in decimal (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **IPv6**:
  - **Length**: 128 bits (16 bytes).
  - **Representation**: Divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).

### **Purpose**

- **Routing**: Facilitates routing of packets between devices across different networks.
- **Addressing**:
  - **IPv4**: Widely used; faces limitations in address space.
  - **IPv6**: Provides a larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices.

---

## **6. Broadcast Address**

### **Bit-wise Structure**
- **IPv4**:
  - **Address**: `255.255.255.255` is used for global broadcast, while network-specific broadcasts use the broadcast address in the network's IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.255` for a network with the `192.168.1.0/24` subnet).
- **IPv6**:
  - **Broadcast**: IPv6 does not use broadcast addresses. Instead, it uses multicast and anycast.

### **Purpose**
- **Global Broadcast**: Sends packets to all devices on the same network segment.
- **Local Broadcast**: Used within a specific subnet or broadcast domain.

### **OSI Layer**
- **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: For Ethernet broadcast.
- **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**: For IPv4 global broadcast.

## **7. Multicast Address**

### **Bit-wise Structure**
- **IPv4**:
  - **Range**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`.
  - **Representation**: An address where the high-order bits are set to `1110` in binary.
- **IPv6**:
  - **Prefix**: Starts with `ff` followed by flags and scope information.

### **Purpose**
- **Group Communication**: Sends packets to a specific group of devices rather than all devices (broadcast) or a single device (unicast).
- **Efficiency**: Reduces network traffic by sending one copy of data to multiple recipients.

### **OSI Layer**
- **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**: For routing multicast packets.
- **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**: For managing multicast traffic on local networks.
