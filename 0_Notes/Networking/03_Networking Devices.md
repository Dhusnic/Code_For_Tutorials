3. it stores a MAC Address Table 
4. It will only send the data to the exact recipient  unlike HUB (which will send to all recipient)
#### MAC Address
A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communication on the physical network segment. Types of MAC addresses include:

1. **Unicast MAC Address**: Identifies a single network interface; used for one-to-one communication.
2. **Multicast MAC Address**: Identifies a group of devices; used for one-to-many communication.
3. **Broadcast MAC Address**: Identifies all devices in a network; used for one-to-all communication.

##### Parts of a MAC Address:
- **OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)**: The first 24 bits (6 hex digits) assigned by IEEE to identify the manufacturer.
- **NIC (Network Interface Controller) Specific**: The last 24 bits (6 hex digits) uniquely assigned by the manufacturer.

##### Example Table of MAC Addresses

| Type          | Example MAC Address    | Description                                      |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Unicast       | 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E      | Address for a single network interface           |
| Multicast     | 01:00:5E:7F:8A:BC      | Address for a specific group of devices          |
| Broadcast     | FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF      | Address for all devices in a network             |

In the example, the OUI (first three octets) identifies the manufacturer, while the NIC-specific part (last three octets) uniquely identifies the device.

4. **Layer 2 Switches**: Operate at the Data Link layer, using MAC addresses to forward data.
5. **Layer 3 Switches**: Function at the Network layer, handling routing tasks based on IP addresses in addition to standard switching.
### Bridges
1. Works in a datalink layer which is layer 2
2. it connects LAN network which are working in a same protocol 
3. it will used to repeat or generate the signal
4. repeater + MAC Address reading Capability
#### Types of Bridges
Bridges are network devices used to connect and filter traffic between different network segments, improving network efficiency. Types of bridges include:

1. **Transparent Bridges**: Operate by learning MAC addresses and forwarding frames only to the destination segment, effectively segmenting the network.
2. **Source Routing Bridges**: Use source routing information embedded in the frame to determine the path for forwarding, commonly used in Token Ring networks.
3. **Translational Bridges**: Convert data formats between different types of network segments, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, enabling communication between them.
### Router

2. it ensures a security and maintains the incoming traffic and outgoing traffics
#### Types of FireWalls
Sure, here are detailed explanations of different types of firewalls:

##### 1. Packet-Filtering Firewalls
- **Function**: Examine individual packets of data as they pass through the firewall.
- **Features**: Decisions are made based on source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols.
- **Advantages**: Simple and efficient; less resource-intensive.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited in scope, does not inspect the payload of the packets, and cannot track connection state.

##### 2. Stateful Inspection Firewalls
- **Function**: Monitor the state of active connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic (e.g., part of an established connection).
- **Features**: Keep track of the state of network connections (such as TCP streams), filtering packets based on state, port, and protocol.
- **Advantages**: More secure than packet-filtering firewalls as they provide a higher level of control and protection.
- **Disadvantages**: More complex and resource-intensive than packet-filtering firewalls.

##### 3. Proxy Firewalls
- **Function**: Act as an intermediary between users and the internet by making requests on behalf of users.
- **Features**: Inspect and filter traffic at the application level, such as HTTP, FTP, and DNS.
- **Advantages**: Can provide detailed logging and access control, and can mask user IP addresses for privacy.
- **Disadvantages**: Can introduce latency, may not support all protocols and applications natively.

##### 4. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW)
- **Function**: Provide advanced security features beyond traditional firewall capabilities.
- **Features**: Include deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), application awareness and control, and advanced threat protection.
- **Advantages**: Comprehensive security with integrated advanced features, better protection against sophisticated threats.
- **Disadvantages**: More expensive and resource-intensive than traditional firewalls, may require more complex configuration and management.

##### 5. Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewalls
- **Function**: Modify network address information in IP headers while in transit, effectively hiding internal IP addresses.
- **Features**: Translate private IP addresses to a public IP address for internet access, and vice versa.
- **Advantages**: Adds a layer of security by keeping internal IP addresses hidden from external networks.
- **Disadvantages**: NAT alone does not inspect the content of the traffic, thus requiring combination with other firewall types for comprehensive security.

##### 6. Web Application Firewalls (WAF)
- **Function**: Specifically designed to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet.
- **Features**: Protect against attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other web application vulnerabilities.
- **Advantages**: Focused protection for web applications, often includes features like load balancing and SSL termination.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited to web traffic, may not address other types of network threats.

##### 7. Unified Threat Management (UTM) Firewalls
- **Function**: Combine multiple security functions into a single appliance.
- **Features**: Include firewall capabilities, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), antivirus, content filtering, and more.
- **Advantages**: Simplified management and deployment, comprehensive protection in a single device.
- **Disadvantages**: May not be as flexible or as powerful as dedicated solutions for each security function, can become a single point of failure.

Each type of firewall offers unique strengths and is suitable for different network environments and security requirements. Often, a combination of multiple types of firewalls is used to provide layered security.
