  1. Client sends a DHCP Discover message.
  2. Server responds with a DHCP Offer.
  3. Client requests the offered IP address (DHCP Request).
  4. Server confirms the assignment (DHCP Acknowledgment).
- **Advantages:** Simplifies network configuration. Reduces manual IP management.
- **Disadvantages:** IP addresses are dynamically assigned and can change.
- **Speed:** Generally quick, but depends on network size and server responsiveness.

### 6. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**
- **Port Number:** 21 (control), 20 (data)
- **OSI Layer:** Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Explanation:** FTP is used for transferring files between a client and a server.
- **Steps Involved:** 
  1. Client connects to the server on port 21 for control.
  2. Authentication (username and password) is performed.
  3. File transfer occurs over port 20.
- **Advantages:** Allows for the transfer of large files. Supports resume of interrupted transfers.
- **Disadvantages:** Transmits data in plain text (not secure).
- **Speed:** Variable, depends on network conditions and server capabilities.

### 7. **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**
- **Port Number:** 22
- **OSI Layer:** Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Explanation:** SFTP is used for secure file transfer over SSH.
- **Steps Involved:** 
  1. Client connects to the server using SSH on port 22.
  2. Authentication occurs.
  3. Files are transferred securely over the same SSH connection.
- **Advantages:** Secure transfer with encryption. Authenticated access.
- **Disadvantages:** More complex setup than FTP.
- **Speed:** Generally similar to FTP but can be affected by encryption overhead.

### 8. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
- **Port Number:** 80
- **OSI Layer:** Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Explanation:** HTTP is used for transferring web pages on the internet.
- **Steps Involved:** 
  1. Client sends an HTTP request to the server.
  2. Server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.
  3. Client renders the response (usually a web page).
- **Advantages:** Simple and easy to implement. Widely supported across the web.
- **Disadvantages:** Not secure (unencrypted).
- **Speed:** Generally fast, but depends on server and network conditions.

### 9. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**
- **Port Number:** 443
- **OSI Layer:** Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Explanation:** HTTPS is HTTP with encryption (SSL/TLS) for secure communication over a network.
- **Steps Involved:** 
  1. Client initiates a connection to the server using HTTPS.
  2. SSL/TLS handshake occurs to establish a secure connection.
  3. Client sends an encrypted HTTP request.
  4. Server processes and responds with an encrypted HTTP response.
- **Advantages:** Secure communication via encryption. Ensures data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Disadvantages:** Slightly more overhead due to encryption/decryption processes.
- **Speed:** Slightly slower than HTTP due to encryption, but generally fast.

### 10. **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)**
- **Port Number:** 110
- **OSI Layer:** Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Explanation:** POP3 is used for retrieving emails from a server to a client.

### 12. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**
- **Port Number:** 25 (default), 587 (for secure submission)
- **OSI Layer:** Application Layer (Layer 7)
- **Explanation:** SMTP is used for sending emails from a client to a server or between servers.
- **Steps Involved:**
