Certainly! Here's the information on CDP, CDP messages, CDP features, and LLDP commands presented in a table format.

### CDP Overview

CDP, or Cisco Discovery Protocol, is a proprietary Layer 2 protocol developed by Cisco Systems. Its primary function is to allow Cisco devices to discover and learn about neighboring Cisco devices directly connected to them on a network. Here's an overview of its key aspects:

1. **Discovery and Neighbor Information:** CDP helps Cisco devices discover and collect information about directly connected Cisco devices, such as routers, switches, access points, and IP phones.

2. **Protocol Operation:** CDP operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model, using multicast frames (specifically using Ethernet SNAP frames with a destination MAC address of 01:00:0c:cc:cc:cc) to communicate.

3. **Information Provided:** It provides information like device type (router, switch, etc.), IP addresses, platform details (such as model and software version), and port IDs (the interface through which CDP frames are exchanged).

4. **Use Cases:** CDP is useful for network administrators to quickly identify and troubleshoot connectivity issues, verify device connections, and gather inventory information about Cisco devices on the network.

5. **Configuration:** CDP is enabled by default on Cisco devices but can be globally disabled or configured per interface using commands like `no cdp run` (to disable globally) or `cdp enable` (to enable on an interface).

6. **Security Considerations:** While CDP provides valuable information for network management, it should be used with caution in untrusted environments due to potential security risks associated with exposing device details.

CDP is widely used within Cisco networks but is not interoperable with non-Cisco devices. Cisco has similar protocols like LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) that offer similar functionality and interoperability with other vendors' networking equipment.

### CDP Commands
Hereâ€™s a table summarizing CDP commands along with their uses, examples, and explanations:

| **Command**             | **Use**                                             | **Explanation**                                                                 | **Example**                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `cdp run`               | Enables CDP globally on the device.                 | Activates CDP across all interfaces on the device.                              | `Router(config)# cdp run`        |
| `no cdp run`            | Disables CDP globally on the device.                | Turns off CDP for the entire device.                                            | `Router(config)# no cdp run`     |
| `cdp enable`            | Enables CDP on a specific interface.                | Turns on CDP on the selected interface if CDP is globally enabled.              | `Router(config-if)# cdp enable`  |
| `no cdp enable`         | Disables CDP on a specific interface.               | Deactivates CDP on the selected interface while CDP remains enabled globally.   | `Router(config-if)# no cdp enable` |
| `show cdp`              | Displays CDP status on the device.                  | Provides information about the global CDP status and configuration.             | `Router# show cdp`               |
