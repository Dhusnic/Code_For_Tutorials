To provide you with the information you're looking for, let's break it down:

### Protocols and their Details

1. **PING**
    - **Default Port:** ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), not a port-based protocol but often associated with a request/reply mechanism.

2. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** [[01_SNMP(Simple_Network_management__Protocol)]]
   - **Default Port:** 161 (SNMPv2c/v3) and 162 (SNMP traps)
   - **Description:** SNMP is used for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior.
   
3. **WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)** [[03_WMI(Windows_Manager_Instrumentation)_Protocol]]
   - **Default Port:** Uses DCOM over various dynamic ports
   - **Description:** WMI is Microsoft's implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), which is an industry initiative to develop a standard technology for accessing management information in an enterprise environment
   
1. **Telnet** 
   - **Default Port:** 23
   - **Description:** Telnet is a network protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.

1. **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)** 
   - **Default Port:** 443
   - **Description:** SSL is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. It evolved into Transport Layer Security (TLS).




2. **TRAP (SNMP Trap)**
   - **Default Port:** 162
   - **Description:** SNMP Trap is a message sent from one SNMP-enabled device to another to alert administrators of specific events.

3. **SSH (Secure Shell)** [[02_SSH(Secure_Shell_Protocol)]]
   - **Default Port:** 22
   - **Description:** SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by using a client-server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with an SSH server.




4. **WINRM (Windows Remote Management)**
    - **Default Port:** 5985 (HTTP), 5986 (HTTPS)
    - **Description:** WINRM is Microsoft's implementation of WS-Management Protocol, which allows hardware and operating systems to be managed through a network for systems running Windows.

5. **WMC (Windows Management Console)**
    - **Description:** WMC is a component of Microsoft Windows that provides a framework and graphical user interface (GUI) for management of computers, network services, and the system itself.
