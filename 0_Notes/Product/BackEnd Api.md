### Summary:
This project structure is organized to separate concerns into categories like configurations, common utilities, services, modules, and tasks. It includes multiple subcategories for specific functionalities such as agent management, authorization, user management, and web socket communication. The use of Docker and various services (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis, Snowflake) suggests a microservices-oriented or distributed system design.
